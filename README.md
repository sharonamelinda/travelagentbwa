# Mini Challenge: Website for UI Engineer Internship at BuildWithAngga.

This project is a submission for the UI Engineer Internship challenge at BuildWithAngga. The website was built using HTML and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) based on a design template from [ShaynaKit](https://shaynakit.com/details/travelbucks-agent-website).
## Overview
This project is a static website created as part of the mini challenge for the BuildWithAngga UI Engineer internship. The goal was to replicate a Figma template design from ShaynaKit using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases my skills in front-end development, including responsive design and clean, maintainable code.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the structure of the web pages.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout.
- Figma (ShaynaKit Template): The design inspiration was taken from one of the ShaynaKit Figma templates. (https://shaynakit.com/details/travelbucks-agent-website)
